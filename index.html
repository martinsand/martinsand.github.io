      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a dad, husband, diy-enthusiast, houseowner, and danish citizen, and I am enjoying all of that.</p>
        
      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>I'm a software developer specialized in computer vision and CNNs for industrial implementations of image and pattern recognition.</p>
      <p>My educational background spans and represent my diverse interest in natural sciences; Master of Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Nanoscience.</p>
      <p>As a Senior Data Scientist at SkySpecs I help create AI models for condition monitoring of Wind Turbine drive trains (their many gears and bearings). 
        Applying image recognition techniques to predictive vibration analysis.</p>
      <p>At my previous job at EIVA A/S as Machine Learning Engineer I did fullstack development of ML-features for their maritime surveyor software suite, 
        and embedded onboard their subsea robots or autonomous drones.</p>
      <p>I won't do facial recognition, personal tracking for neither ads or worse, weapons, and what else I don't see fit for a modern and fair society.</p>
