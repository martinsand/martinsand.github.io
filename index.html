      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> I'm a software developer specialized in computer vision and CNNs for industrial implementations of image recognition. 
      My educational background spans and represent my diverse interest in science; Master of Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Nanoscience. 
      At my job at EIVA A/S as Machine Learning Engineer I do fullstack development of ML-features for maritime surveyor software suites, and embedded onboard their subsea robots or autonomous drones. 
      I won't do facial recognition, personal tracking for neither ads or worse, weapons, and and lot more. </p>
